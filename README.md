# Flappy-Bird-Game-Recreation
Flappy Bird game built with Java for the Processing Development Environment

I wrote this program as a part of a Java school project. I was able to learn the principles of object-oriented programming. 
The program has various objects such as the bird, the ground, and the pipes, that I provided attributes to give functionality resembling the popular mobile game of the same title Flappy Bird.
